  bio: `Haifan Yin received his Ph.D. degree from Telecom ParisTech (also known as Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications, or ENST), France, in Dec. 2015, under the supervision of Prof. David Gesbert. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2009 and 2012 respectively. From 2016 to 2017, he has been a DSP engineer in Sequans Communications — an IoT chipmaker based in Paris, France. From 2017 to 2019, he has been a senior research engineer in Shanghai Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., where he made substantial contributions to physical layer research and 5G standards. Since May 2019, he has joined the School of Electronic Information and Communications at Huazhong University of Science and Technology as a full professor. He is a holder of more than 25 patents. One of his technical papers reaches over 1000 citations. His current research interests include 5G and 6G networks, signal processing, machine learning, and massive MIMO systems. He was a recipient of the China Youth May Fourth Medal (the top honor for young Chinese), the National Champion of 2021 High Potential Innovation Prize awarded by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and a recipient of the 2024 Stephen O. Rice Prize.`,

    description:
      "Massive MIMO is one of the key enablers of the 5G cellular systems. Compared to traditional MIMO with fewer base station antennas, massive MIMO can offer unprecedented spectral efficiency gains. Despite the technology hype and great expectations, some of the latest field trials have unfortunately been disappointing when it comes to actual system performance in mobility scenarios. It was observed that moderate-mobility at 30 km/h leads to as much as 50% performance reduction versus low-mobility at 3 km/h.",

Our research explores partial reciprocity-based channel prediction, manifold learning-based CSI feedback, and codebook design to bridge the FDD CSI gap, achieving near-optimal performance with minimal overhead.",
